      <h3>About:</h3>
      <p>Hello everyone and welcome to my website. This website is the spawn of a simple HTML and CSS project for my EID100 class at Ryerson University.</p>
      <p>Please feel free to read this single page in awe.</p>
      <h3>Background:</h3>
      <p>My name is Kris Di Pietro, and I am a 4th year undergraduate student are Ryerson university. I am in the performance production program and I intend to graduate this year.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Top reasons for making your own awesome website!</li>
          <ol>
            <li>You can spend all your waking hours on <a style="color: green" href="http://www.codeacademy.com"><b>Code Academy</b></a> learning how to use HTML!</li>
            <li>You can use your website to impress your friends and family. Or even your business partners!</li>
            <li>Or perhaps your prof just told you to... But even though your list items sound mildly grumpy, you are actually enjoying learning how to code and are only grumpy because you were up until 5am working on another project for that same prof! Go you!</li>
